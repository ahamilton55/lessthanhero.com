I'm not totally sure why but I stopped blogging a while ago. I think about beginning again but I can never quite get myself to actually do it, until now.

One of my favorite things to do is to help people learn and fix issues they might run into. I believe that blogging is a great way to do that with a large audience (even if my blog is not accessed very often). All that I hope is that one person might find what I'm doing here helpful. Other than that, this will mostly be a scratch pad for getting ideas and projects out of my head and onto something less crowded.

So what can you expect from my blog? Well I'm not 100% sure but it will be mostly technical. There may be some cultural stuff as well and a rant from time to time. As said before, I just hope that I can can help one person with something he or she is attempting to accomplish.

That's all for now but hopefully I'll have something else soon!
